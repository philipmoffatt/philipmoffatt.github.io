The *South Fork Palouse* (SFP) watershed is a snow-to-rain transitioning catchmentrelevant to downstream ecosystem health where hydrological patterns may changeappreciably with climate warming (Callahan et al., 1999; Chang et al., 2012).Understanding regional precipitation patterns is important for assessing the effects ofclimate variability. Stable water isotopes provide a method for examining the processesthat influence precipitation from source to point of collection (Aragu√°s-Aragu√°s et al.,2000). Characterizing the regional patterns and short term processes that shape SFPprecipitation is the focus of this study.  

(1) Sub cloud evaporation during spring and summer rains combined with snowformation processes during water years 2017-2019 influenced the slope and intercept ofthe LMWL.  

(2) Seasonal temperature controls ùõø18O‚Ä∞ variation for South Fork Palouse watershed inagreement with previous studies. Sub cloud evaporation in the summer drives d-excessvariation which is stable, on average, for winter precipitation.  

(3) Source location and storm track conditions correlate to d-excess variation in the largestsnow event for the winter of 2020.  


(4) Storm tracks suggest advective mixing is driving short term ùõø18O‚Ä∞ variation.
